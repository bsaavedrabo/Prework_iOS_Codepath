App Idea: 
Problem:
Berea College students struggle to get around without owning a car and public transportation (FootHills) has limited hours. Due to personal experiences as international students, we were inspired to create a solution that would not only support people to find rides faster (rather than begging people on the Facebook group) but also get open a gig for people who own cars on campus.
Solution: 
iOS app that allows Berea College students to earn $ and/or find rides faster

## Notes

I googled how to add a link to a button.
